		Oh the joy. The joy of terrorizing the players and testificates of Minecraftia. Here is what you need to know about Weeping Angels:
		<br /><br />
		Don't Blink. Whatever you do, Don't Blink. Blink and your dead. They are faster then you can believe. However, take assurance in the fact that they are Quantum locked life forms. They literally, cannot moved while they are being observed. They turn to stone.
		<br /><br />
		OK! So here is the break down!
		<br />
		<UL>
			<LI>Cannot move while any other player/angel can see them</LI>
			<LI>Extremely Fast, when able to move</LI>
			<LI>Loves to go after players and either:
				<br />
				<OL>
					<LI><a href="#Entities.WeepingAngel.Conversion">Convert</a> them into a Weeping Angel</LI>
					<LI>Teleport them to another 'time'</LI>
					<LI>Kill them</LI>
				</OL>
			</LI>
			<LI>Will get old and decrepit over time, causing them to decay</LI>
			<LI>When extremely old, will a-ceullularly procreate, spawning a baby angel
				<br />
				- Baby Angels are 1/2 the height, and twice the speed of a normal angel
			</LI>
			<LI>When teleporting or converting a player (mentioned above), can take some of the player's energy and become slightly younger</LI>

				When a player is infected by a dormant Weeping Angel, they only have so long to live. As the angel inside you grows bigger and stronger, you will find that your sight gets dimmer. By they time the angel is ready to emerge, you will have lost all sight, and hope most likely. At this point, the angel will emerge will full health (20/20), and immediately kill teh player.
				<br />
				Also, when that occurs, the angel has the opportunity to copy your name, and steal any inventory you had at the time, so be careful out there.
				<br />
				PS: There is no way to be cured of an Angel Conversion yet.
